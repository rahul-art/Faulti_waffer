# Faulti_waffer
in this project we are making complete pipeline based on customized machine learning approach. 
to run the project follow the steps
1. clone the repo 
git clone ``` https://github.com/rahul-art/Faulti_waffer.git ```
2. create new environment 
``` conda create -n faulti_waffer python=3.6 ```
3. run the file main.py
``` python run main.py ```
after that the complete code take 10 to 30 minutes of time to check for data and then create best models for different clusters maintain their logs for each and every step like exception handling, error handling, next execution handling and at last we can use our trained models for prediction system itself abel to select beset models for different clusters
